In this thesis the impact of correlated disorder in particle positions is discussed in the context of the euclidean random matrix model. It consists of an isotropic system of $N$ particles in a $d$-dimensional space where the dynamics are given by a pair interaction spring function $f$. It is furthermore frozen in time and in an athermal state with a reference system. Hereby results a random matrix $\tilde U(f,R)$ whose spectral properties are discussed using a field theoretical approach. After introducing the Dyson formalism and deriving the feynman rules, the static structure factor $S_*$ is introduced, based on the Fourier transform of the radial particle distribution function $g_0 - 1$. Using a self consistent Born approximation, the one loop self energy $\Sigma^{(1)}$ is corrected to $\Sigma_{S_*}^{(1)}$ and the corresponding Dyson equation is derived. \\

By its numerical solution to an example of a three dimensional space using a Heaviside step function as the spring function, the impact of the static structure factor on the speed of sound is discussed. It is shown that the structure factor is stable for all tested densities but has no significant impact on the speed of sound. The dispersion relation is shown to be nearly unchanged for all densities. It is also discussed when the model reaches physical applicability by a fully positive dispersion relation. Lastly the results are compared to and verified by a gaussian radial distribution.
