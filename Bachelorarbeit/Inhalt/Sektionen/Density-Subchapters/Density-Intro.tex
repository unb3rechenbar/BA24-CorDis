Up until now we have been discussing uncorrelated systems of particles, in which the probability of particle occurrence is given without consideration of other particles positions. This simplification is not applicable due to several caveats, such as the vanishing probability in the large volume limit $\abs{V_{d,N}}\to\infty\implies 1/\abs{V_{d,N}}\to 0$ and no consideration of the mediums \emph{structure} in any way. We aim to introduce this property into the formalism and to present an approximation for higher order diagrams in the Dyson expansion.
