\begin{mlem}{Relation of Connected and Disconnected Representation \cite{Hansen_McDonald_1979}}{ConnectedGraphsRelation}
    Let $\mcG_c$ be a set of distinct, connected and irreduceable\footnote{By \emph{irreduceable} we mean $\forall C\in\mcG_c:\nexists C_1,C_2\in\mcG_c:C_1\cdot C_2 = C$, with $\cdot$ stating a canonical product of two diagrams.} diagrams. Let furthermore $\mcG$ be the set of all $C\in\mcG_c$ and all possible products of graphs in $\mcG_c$. Then it holds
    \[
        \mathit{FunctionSum}(\mcG) = \exp(\mathit{FunctionSum}(\mcG_c)) - 1
    \]
    where $\mathit{FunctionSum}$ represents the function that by summarization of diagrams is composed, for example a relation to the MGF.
