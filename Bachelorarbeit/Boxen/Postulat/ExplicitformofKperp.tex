\begin{mpos}{Explicit form of $(\mcL K_{q,i}^\perp)$}{ExplicitFormOfLaplaceK}
    For a given response function $K_{q,i}$ we can write the Laplace transformation of its transversal component relative to its generating wave vector $q\in\R^d$ as 
    \[
        (\mcL K_{q,i}^\perp)(s) = \frac{
            1
        }{
            s + \xi + q^2\cdot (\mcL g_{q,i})(s)
        }
    \]
    by setting $\xi := \zeta_0/m$.
