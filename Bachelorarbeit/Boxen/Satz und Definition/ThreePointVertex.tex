\begin{msatdef}{Three Point Fourier Vertex}{ThreePointVertex}
    Given by $\mu(p,q) := G_0(p,z)^{-1} + V(q,p)$, where $V$ is the vertex function from \ref{msatdef:VertexFunction}. It has the symmetry $\mu(p,q) = \mu(-p,-q)$.
\end{msatdef}
\begin{proof}
    The stated symmetries follow directly from theorem \ref{msatdef:VertexFunction} and $G_0(-p,z) = G_0(p,z)$.
\end{proof}
