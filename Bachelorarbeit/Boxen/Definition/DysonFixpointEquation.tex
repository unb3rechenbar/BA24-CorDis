\begin{mdef}{Dyson Fixpoint Equation}{DysonFixpoint}
    For $G_0\in\R$ and $\Sigma\in\R$, the propagator $G$ is under the condition of $G_0\cdot\Sigma\in[0,1)$ given by the Dyson Fixpoint Equation
    \[
        G = G_0 + G_0\cdot\Sigma\cdot G \iff G = \frac{1}{G_0^{-1} - \Sigma}.
    \]
    Hereby $G_0$ states the system's bare propagator and $\Sigma$ the self energy term.
