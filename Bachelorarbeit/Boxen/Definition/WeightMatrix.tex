\begin{mdef}{Weight Matrix}{WeightMatrix}
    We call $G = (V,W)$ a \emph{weighted graph} if $\abs{V} < \infty$ and $W: V\times V\to \R$ is a function. If $W$ is symmetric and $W(v,v) = 0$ for all $v\in V$, then we call $G$ an \emph{undirected weighted graph}. The \emph{underlying graph} of $G$ is then given by its set of edges $E = \{(u,v)\in V\times V: W(u,v)\neq 0\}$. If $\forall v,q\in V:W(v,w)=1$, $W$ becomes the adjacency matrix $A$.
