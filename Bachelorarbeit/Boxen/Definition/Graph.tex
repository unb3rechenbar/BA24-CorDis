\begin{mdef}{Graph}{Graph}
    A graph $G$ is a pair $G = (V,E)$, where $V$ is a set of elements called \emph{vertices} and $E\subseteq V^2$ is a set of edges, each of which is a pair of vertices. We call $G$ \emph{undirected} if $(v_1,v_2)\in E \implies (v_2,v_1)\in E$. We say $v$ \emph{initiates} (and is adjacent to) $w$ if $(v,w)\in E$ and $v$ \emph{terminates} $w$ if $(w,v)\in E$, in short $v\sim w$ and $w\sim v$ respectively.
