\begin{mdef}{The Hamiltonian}{Hamiltonian}
    Let $U\in C^2(V_{d,N})$ for $\Gamma\relcom\R^d$ and $V_{d,N}:=\Gamma^N$ be a potential energy function of a system of $N\in\N$ particles. For $r\in V_{d,N}$ and $\phi\in\text{TF}(V_{d,N},r)$ we define the corresponding $H(r,\phi):=U(r + \phi)$. Its approximation will be denoted by $H^{(n)}(r,\phi):=\sum_{k=0}^n\frac{1}{k!} D_\phi^kU(r)^k$.
    
    \footnote{We denote the differential operator $D_\phi^k$ as the $k$-th derivative of $U$ with respect to its argument $r$ in direction $\phi$. At first order we therefore have $D_\phi U(r) = \dv{t}U(r+t\phi)\big|_{t=0}$.}
